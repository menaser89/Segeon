# Child Pool

`child_process` pool implementation suporting:

- Global and per-pool worker limits
- Background vs. foreground execution mode
- Integrated error handling

## Usage

### Pool
```
 var ChildPool = require('./child-pool');

ChildPool.isBackground(true);

var worker = new ChildPool(__dirname + '/child-worker', options);
worker.send({foo: 'bar'}, function() {
});
```

Options:

- `workers`: Number of workers that might be spawned. Defaults to # CPUs.
- `keepAlive`: Time duration in ms to keep idle workers alive. Defaults to 500ms.

#### #send(message, callback)

Queues `message` for the worker, calling `callback` upon competion.

`callback` will only be called once per message cycle. If the client sends out of band messages they will trigger an `error` event on the pool instance and may be handled as appropriate there.

#### #sendAll(message)

Broadcasts `message` to all live workers immediately.

As there is no callback associated with this event, workers receiving this message should not send return messages. Those that do will cause an `error` event on the pool instance.

### Worker

A global `worker` object is declared within the worker context. This exposes 3 `process.send` wrappers that simplify data respones.

```
process.on('message', function(message) {
  worker.data({foo: 'bar'});
});
```

#### #data(data)

Send a data message to the parent.

#### #error(err)

Send a non-fatal error message to the parent. This may be an `Error` or string instance. In the later case the stack trace of the call will be associated with the message.

#### #fatal(err)

Send a fatal error message to the parent. This may be an `Error` or string instance. In the later case the stack trace of the call will be associated with the message. The parent will terminate the worker after receiving this message.

## Global worker limit

Undermost circumstances, the library will not spawn more than the number of CPUs across the entire node instance. The exceptions are:

- `ChildPool.isBackground` has been called with a truthy value

  Forces the library to not spawn more than #CPUs - 1. To ensure that there is a process open for interactive processes.

- When there is only one CPU core

  The library will still spawn two workers.

The global worker limit constrains any values that might have been passed in the pool initialization options.
